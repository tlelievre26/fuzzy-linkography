	<h1>Fuzzy Linkography</h1>
	<p>Below are some test examples of <em>fuzzy linkographs</em>: automatically generated diagrams of design or ideation sessions, highlighting semantic links between <em>design moves</em> that took place during the session.</p>
  <p>As in conventional linkography, moves are arranged left to right in a single linear timeline. Links are drawn below moves to connect them. In fuzzy linkography, links are inferred by a computational process rather than hand-coded, so we use line color to indicate the <em>strength</em> of each link rather than treating all links as strictly binary.</p>
